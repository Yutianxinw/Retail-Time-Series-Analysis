# üì¶ Walmart M5 Forecasting: Time Series Prediction with LSTM & GRU

This project tackles the M5 Forecasting Accuracy Challenge by predicting unit sales of Walmart retail goods. We applied deep learning models (LSTM, GRU) and a baseline LightGBM model to capture complex temporal patterns and improve predictive performance.

## üéØ Objective

Forecast daily sales for thousands of Walmart items across stores in CA, TX, and WI using the official [M5 Forecasting dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy/overview). The final model was submitted to Kaggle and scored using the **WRMSSE** metric.

## üß± Feature Engineering

Features used to enhance signal quality and model learning:

- **Lag features** (e.g., demand from 7/28 days ago)
- **Rolling statistics** (means and stds over 7‚Äì30 day windows)
- **Calendar-based**: day of week, holidays, SNAP flags
- **Price dynamics**: price normalization, change rate
- **Hierarchical sales ratios**: store/category/department-level aggregates

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Stack

- Python (TensorFlow/Keras, pandas, numpy, LightGBM)
- Notebooks: `LSTM(Adam).ipynb`, `LSTM(AdamW).ipynb`, `GRU.ipynb`
- Evaluation metric: WRMSSE (Weighted Root Mean Squared Scaled Error)
